# AnchorSheetBehavior
This repo contains an example of the modification of the BottomSheetBehavior with Anchor state.

Fine more about it in my medium blog post.
If you want to use it you can directly copy the [AnchorSheetBehavior](https://github.com/skimarxall/AnchorSheetBehavior/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/hardsoftstudio/anchorbottomsheet/AnchorSheetBehavior.java)
